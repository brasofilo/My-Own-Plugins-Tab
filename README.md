# [My Own Plugins Tab](https://github.com/brasofilo/My-Own-Plugins-Tab)
<sup>*Version 2013.10.19*</sup>

####*Separate your plugins from the others in the Plugins admin screen.*

**For developers**:  
see your plugins, and others', in separated tabs, quite useful when they start to count in dozens.

**For everybody**:  
simply add a comma-separated list of authors and you'll be able to sort the plugins in two groups.
